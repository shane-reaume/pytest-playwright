Lesson 1 - Lists of Dataclasses
Objectives:
- Describe how dataclasses can be nested inside of lists
- Compare and contrast lists and dataclasses
- Create a literal list of dataclass instances using constructor functions and list literal syntax
- Write expressions that access the attributes of a specific element of a list of dataclasses
- Determine the type and appropriate name for an iteration variable for a list of dataclasses
- Write expressions that access the attributes of all the instances in a list of dataclasses inside a for loop
- Define a function that consumes and potentially produces a list of dataclasses
- Apply for loop patterns to operate on multiple fields of lists of dataclasses
- Compose loop patterns together inside of functions that operate on lists of dataclasses
- Distinguish between the list variable, iteration variable, and accumulation variable when processing a list of dataclasses
- Develop appropriate test cases for functions that consume a list of dataclasses
- Interpret a stack/heap diagram that visualizes a list of dataclasses being processed
