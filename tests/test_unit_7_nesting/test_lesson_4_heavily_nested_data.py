Lesson 4 - Heavily Nested Data
Objectives:
- Describe how lists and dataclasses can be generally nested an arbitrary number of times
- Distinguish between primitive and composite data types
- Define dataclasses that have lists and dataclasses inside multiple layers
- Create instances of heavily nested data
- Write functions that process heavily nested data
- Use for loops, indexing, subscripting, and attribute access to process heavily nested data
- Interpret a class diagram to determine the control structures needed to process heavily nested data
- Use temporary variables to break up long attribute access chains
