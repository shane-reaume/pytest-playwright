Lesson 1 - Indexes
Objectives:
- Explain the difference between iterating over indexes and iterating over values
- Determine if a situation requires value iteration, index iteration, or iterating over both kinds
- Use the len function to calculate the length of a list
- Use the range function to create a sequence of integers from 0 to that number
- Use the enumerate function to create a sequence of values and indexes from a list
- Update specific values in a list via their index
- Update a list of values via their index
- Describe the tradeoff between copying a list and modifying a list
- Describe the tradeoffs between working with lists indirectly through indexes as opposed to directly with values
- Assign multiple variables at once to swap elements in a list
