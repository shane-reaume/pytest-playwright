Lesson 2 - Loop Patterns
Objectives:
- List and describe the use cases of the basic for loop patterns
- Use the count pattern to count the elements in a list
- Use the sum pattern to add numbers in a list
- Use the accumulate pattern to combine strings
- Use the accumulate pattern to combine Boolean values following the "any" and "all" variants
- Use the map pattern to transform a list
- Debug a program that is looping infinitely because the loop accidentally appends to its own iteration list
- Identify whether a statement is before, inside, after, or outside a loop
