Lesson 3 - More Loop Patterns
Objectives:
- List and describe the filter, find, take, and min/max loop patterns
- Use the filter pattern to remove elements from a list and count only certain elements from a list
- Use the find pattern to get the first or last element in a list that matches a condition
- Use the take pattern to get all the elements in a list until a condition is matched
- Use the min/max pattern to get the highest or lowest element in a list
- Incorporate a guard before the min/max pattern to avoid index errors
