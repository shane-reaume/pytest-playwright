Lesson 2 - While Loop Patterns
Objectives:
- Trace a numeric while loop
- Use a while loop to handle potentially incorrect user input
- Use the Do-Until loop pattern to delay a while loop's conditional check
- Use the Do-Until loop pattern to avoid redundant user input
- Use a while loop to repeatedly process user input to dispatch commands in a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop
- Explain the purpose of intentional infinite loops with the Main Game Loop pattern
- Trace stochastic behavior of Random Loops
- Trace complex list iteration using a while loop
