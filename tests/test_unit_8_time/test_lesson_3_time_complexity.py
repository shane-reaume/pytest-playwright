Lesson 3 - Time Complexity
Objectives:
- List the three main questions that programmers use to evaluate a program
- Define the terms correctness, readability, and efficiency
- Compare and contrast different ways of measuring the performance of a program
- Exactly measure the execution time of a program using a clock
- Explain how execution time can be related to the size of the input to the program
- Explain how the RAM model works and its limitations
- Describe the number of steps that a general kind of statement will take
- Estimate the number of steps a program takes to execute using the RAM model
- Give examples of code with constant, linear, and quadratic time relationships
- Identify programs as taking constant, linear, or quadratic time
